This project is a webscrapper I made based off a binary search tree word search I did for data structures class

The program downloads all text in <p> tags from a website and stores it in the webpage.txt file. It then creates a binary search tree with each word but checks that the word does not exist in the ignore.txt file first and prints out the frequencies of all the words that appear the specified amount of times. 

It takes in two commandline arguments. the first argument is the url of the webpage and the second one is the threshold of word frequencies desired.

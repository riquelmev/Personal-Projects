<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">States around the country continued on Thursday to navigate a high-stakes public health balancing act, with some preparing to ease coronavirus restrictions and others imposing new ones — all under the watchful eye of stir-crazy residents eager to return to their favorite stores, restaurants and beaches.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In California, Florida and other coastal states, governors wrestled with squaring constituents’ demands for relief from the spring heat against the potentially lethal consequences of loosening social distancing rules in ways that might make beach blankets and lawn chairs new virus hot spots. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday shut down the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/04/25/eager-early-risers-hit-the-beach-in-san-clemente-as-closure-lifts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">beaches in Orange County</a>, rolling back earlier attempts at giving people there a chance to stroll along the shore while staying a safe distance from one another. But Alabama moved to reopen its beaches, and Texas will do the same in parts of the state on Friday, even as health experts warn that doing so could produce a surge in new virus cases.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This disease isn’t going away,” Mr. Newsom warned, noting that the pandemic had claimed at least 95 lives in California in the previous 24 hours.</p>
<p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p>
<p class="css-8hvvyd">The volume of density, the volume of people and concentrated space, particularly in a few cities — few coastal cities off and around the Orange County area. Those were the point of particular concern. So today, we want to make some clarifications that we’re going to do a hard close in that part of the state, just in the Orange County area. Specific issues on some of those beaches have raised alarm bells. People that are congregating there that weren’t practicing physical distancing. So Orange County’s been on our list of health concern, and while they’ve done a wonderful job down there, I just think we can tighten that up a little bit. And so we’re going to have a temporary pause on the beaches down there — state and local beaches. And my job as governor is to keep you safe. And when our health folks tell me they can’t promise that if we promote another weekend like we had, then I have to make this adjustment.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, millions more Americans will soon be able to eat at restaurants and shop in stores by Friday, the first day of May. Governors in several states — including Alabama, Maine, Tennessee and Texas — planned to allow <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html" title="">stay-at-home orders to expire</a>, paving the way for certain businesses to reopen and ending an unparalleled month in which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html" title="">nine in 10 residents in the United States</a> were told to stay at home to help stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federal guidelines encouraging people to curtail nearly all public activities expired Thursday after President Trump did not extend them. Iowa, North Dakota and Wyoming were among the other states planning to ease their rules.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The latest reopenings represent a pivotal moment in America’s response to the virus, even as the number of deaths from it in the United States has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">surged past 60,000</a>. Texas is expected to take one of the most expansive actions on Friday, allowing retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls to reopen and operate at 25 percent capacity.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But figuring out how to keep coastal areas safe through a patchwork of evolving rules represents one of the toughest dilemmas for state officials. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted pressure to close all beaches, insisting that the decision should be made locally. The governors of states as disparate politically as Texas, Alabama and New Jersey all moved this week to loosen similar restrictions. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On both coasts, access to the ocean has taken on a more practical attraction: Temperatures in California reached 100 degrees last week, and parts of Florida have been experiencing record heat, making beaches one of the few places for residents without pools to cool off outdoors.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The beach is sort of this sacred space, almost, for Florida,” said Craig Pittman, the author of five books about the state. “A lot of people who grew up here think of it as, ‘That’s my beach.’ If you can’t go to the beach, what is Florida?”</p>
<p class="css-1uuihdo">Some states are starting to lift restrictions put in place to curb the coronavirus pandemic, while others are extending orders to stay home.</p>
<p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p>
<p class="css-8hvvyd">I thank you for the enormous help in our darkest hour of need — ventilators, as you can see, P.P.E., testing sites. Now I think we’re going to be in a very good place, thanks to you and your team, as it relates to expanding testing dramatically. So that we’ll be able to begin to take those steps to reopen. We’ve been crushed as a state as you know. It’s a state you know very well. We have 6,770 fatalities, but the curves, thank God, are beginning to show promise. And we’re beginning to take some baby steps on that road to reopen — in fact, we’ve announced that as of this weekend, our state, county parks, golf, under certain protocols as of Saturday morning, will be it will be able to be open again. And that’s a step on that road.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New Jersey reported 460 new virus-related deaths on Thursday, more than any other state in the nation.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The state is now reporting more new deaths than neighboring New York, which saw 306 new deaths on Thursday, less than half of what it was reporting each day when the outbreak peaked there this month.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is the single biggest day that we’ve had,” Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said, calling the daily toll “a very sobering number.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The increase came in a week when Mr. Murphy, encouraged by other measures that showed New Jersey making progress in fighting the virus, began to sketch out how the state might reopen in the weeks ahead. The plans include the reopening of state and county parks on Saturday, a move Mr. Murphy attributed to steady declines in virus-related hospitalizations and the rate of positive tests.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New Jersey has had the second-highest number of virus cases in the United States, behind only New York. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">At least 7,228 residents have died</a>, a figure Mr. Murphy called “staggering.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Murphy warned weeks ago that both the outbreak and the state’s efforts to fight it trailed what was happening in New York.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re a couple of beats behind New York,” he said on April 13 at a news conference with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and several other governors. At the time, the number of deaths in New York was surging even as hospitalizations had started to level off.</p>
<p class="css-1uuihdo">A detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a prime political target in partisan clashes over stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus outbreak, signed three executive orders on Thursday to reinstate a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/michigan-protests-capitol-virus-armed.html" title="">state of emergency</a> during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The moves, which put into place a new state of emergency through May 28, were in response to the Republican-led State Legislature’s refusal to extend the original emergency declaration on the day it was set to expire. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Republican lawmakers have tried to strip the governor’s power to declare a state of emergency, which underpins the stay-at-home order. Michigan has had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">more Covid-19 deaths</a> than every state except New York and New Jersey. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“By refusing to extend the emergency and disaster declaration, Republican lawmakers are putting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk,” Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m not going to let that happen.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her order came on a day when protesters, some of them armed, gathered at the State Capitol in Lansing to oppose stay-at-home orders. State Senator Dayna Polehanki, a Democrat, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/SenPolehanki/status/1255899318210314241" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">shared a photograph of protesters with rifles</a> inside the building, as well as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/SenPolehanki/status/1255856981715193857" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a video of hundreds of people outside</a>.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is legal to carry firearms inside the State Capitol, but many of the protesters were not wearing masks or following social distancing measures. Some demanded to be let onto the House floor, which was not allowed, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apnews.com/a2aea0faacadbd3b9f5c9238d7bc6e72" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Associated Press</a>. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The demonstration was reminiscent of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/coronavirus-rules-protests.html" title="">a larger gathering in Lansing</a> on April 15, when thousands of protesters <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-protests-trump.html" title="">mobilized by conservative groups</a> created a traffic jam on the streets around the Capitol.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Whitmer imposed some of the country’s most severe restrictions on April 9, including a ban on travel to vacation homes and the sale of paint, garden supplies and furniture in large stores. Critics have emphasized that the economic shutdown was affecting livelihoods.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, Speaker Lee Chatfield, a Republican, criticized the governor’s decision to issue a new emergency order. “Today, we offered our hand of partnership to the governor,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/LeeChatfield/status/1256013003851534337" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">he said in a tweet</a>. “No politics. We’re all in this together and we should all work together.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She just said no,” he added. “Very disappointing.”</p>
<p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p>
<p class="css-8hvvyd">For 430 people to come back — with what’s happening in the District of Columbia kind of changed the timing when we come back. But people will be back next week. Small groups can come back, and maybe they have a full committee meeting or maybe they have a virtual or maybe they have a hybrid, but work will be done. We’ve had already about 60 meetings in this period of time. Some of it oversight, some of it legislation and the rest from our committees, virtually or otherwise. The chairs of the committees are making their decisions about how they go forward.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Senator Mitch McConnell’s plan to bring the Senate back to Washington next week drew criticism on Thursday from Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, who said it could endanger not only lawmakers and their aides but also low-level workers, many of whom are minorities and at higher risk of infection and death.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Democrats have been particularly critical of the decision to return given that Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, has not scheduled any virus-related work and is instead planning to move ahead on nominations, including of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/senate-republicans-judicial-nominees.html" title="">judge nominated for a federal appeals court</a>.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell’s announcement comes as virus cases keep rising in the District of Columbia, where nearly half the population is black. District residents are still bound by a stay-at-home order.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Democratic leaders <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F04%2F28%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fhouse-return-coronavirus.html&amp;v=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">scrapped their plans</a> to call the House back into session next week, saying they were acting on the advice of Congress’s attending physician, who told them it was a health risk.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eight Capitol Police officers and 11 facilities workers have already tested positive, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, wrote in a letter to Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, adding that “returning the Senate for nonessential business is not worth the risk.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said her new plan was to reconvene the week of May 11 and begin consideration of another sweeping response measure that could top $1 trillion. She said the measure would include funding for state, local, tribal and municipal governments, which Mr. McConnell has resisted. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump suggested Thursday evening that he was in no hurry to pass more aid for states, saying at a White House briefing that “the Republican-run states are in strong shape,” a dynamic that he suggested would strengthen his “negotiating position.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that he would look at the issue, after a pause. “If we do that, we’ll have to get something for it,” he said.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">President Trump announced that the federal government would increase inspections of nursing homes, which have been at the center of the pandemic. The facilities would be required to report cases directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with testing data posted online.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I guess you could call it a little bit of a weak spot because things are happening at the nursing homes that we are not happy about,” Mr. Trump said at the White House during an event focused on protecting older Americans from the virus. “We don’t want to have them happen, so we will be taking care of it very carefully and methodically.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The inspections will be financed by money from the federal relief packages approved by Congress, Mr. Trump said. Testing data from nursing homes will be posted online, and facilities will be required to report cases to residents and their family members, the president said. Mr. Trump said a commission of industry experts, doctors, scientists, family members and patient advocates would be formed to monitor safety and quality.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Kevin Kavanaugh, a Kentucky physician who has lobbied for greater transparency from nursing homes, said the announcement was a big deal. “If you report these pathogens, you’re able to better formulate strategies to prevent them from coming in,” he said. “If you cover up the problem, you have no idea how to stop it from happening.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The New York Times has identified more than 6,400 nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases. More than 100,000 residents and staff members at those facilities have contracted the virus, and more than 17,000 have died. That means more than a quarter of the U.S. deaths in the pandemic have been linked to long-term care facilities.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After flight attendants and pilots criticized them for not doing more to protect employees, large airlines in the United States and around the world announced this week that they would require their crews to wear masks. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some went even further and said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/business/airlines-masks-coronavirus-passengers.html" title="">passengers would have to do so</a>, too.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said on Thursday that they<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>would start requiring all passengers to wear a face covering in the coming weeks, a policy that would also apply to their flight attendants. They join Lufthansa, JetBlue and Frontier Airlines, all of which made similar announcements this week.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Southwest Airlines said this week that its flight attendants would soon be wearing masks, joining United Airlines, which announced a similar policy late last week.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Airlines have been slow to require masks in part because they have been hard to come by, and labor unions like the Association of Flight Attendants have been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/afacwa/pages/2667/attachments/original/1587675776/4-23-2020_AFA_PPE_Letter_DOT_HHS_FINAL.pdf?1587675776" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">pushing for federal policies</a> to make masks mandatory. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many flight crews, the risk of infection has been mitigated by the nearly complete drop-off in air travel. Most planes are flying virtually empty. But some early data suggests that air travel might be past its lowest point of the crisis.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday announced a national initiative to more quickly research how the coronavirus was spreading around the United States, bringing together at least 75 public health, academic and commercial institutions studying its genome.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the virus replicates, tiny mutations accumulate in its genetic code. Those differences help scientists trace patterns of transmission and investigate outbreaks. They also provide an understanding of how the virus is evolving, which can affect the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Historically, laboratories studying the genomes of pathogens released only general information about them, often in academic journals. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That began to change in recent years with food-borne illnesses, as officials realized that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">publicly sharing gene sequences</a> allowed scientists to find links with greater speed and react to save lives. Gene sequences are also shared to help track influenza, and officials used them to respond to Ebola outbreaks <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/world/africa/genome-studies-show-how-ebola-spread-initially.html" title="">in West Africa several years ago</a>.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The sequences that participating labs share as part of the coronavirus project, which began in early April before being announced, will be used for surveillance, emergency response and applied research, according to the C.D.C.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The figures announced on Thursday by the Labor Department brought the number of workers joining the official jobless ranks in the last six weeks to more than 30 million, underscoring just how dire economic conditions remain.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many state agencies still find themselves overwhelmed by the flood of claims, leaving perhaps millions with dwindling resources to pay the rent or put food on the table.</p>

<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If anything, the job losses may be far worse than government figures indicate, according to many economists. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that roughly 50 percent more people than counted as filing claims in a recent four-week period may have qualified for benefits but were stymied in applying or did not even try because they found the process too formidable.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The problem is even bigger than the data suggest,” said Elise Gould, a senior economist with the institute, a left-leaning research group. “We’re undercounting the economic pain.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Systems that were devised to treat each unemployment case as potentially fraudulent are now rushing to deal with millions of newly unemployed people.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stocks fell on Thursday, giving up some of their gains from the day before, after the weekly unemployment report. The S&amp;P 500 closed down nearly 1 percent. </p>

<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Senior Trump administration officials have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html" title="">pushed American spy agencies</a> to hunt for evidence to support an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html" title="">unsubstantiated theory</a> that a government laboratory in Wuhan, China, was the origin of the outbreak, according to current and former American officials. The effort comes as President Trump escalates a public campaign to blame China for the pandemic.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some intelligence analysts are concerned that the pressure from administration officials will distort assessments about the virus and that they could be used as a political weapon in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-us-china.html" title="">an intensifying battle with Beijing</a> over the outbreak that has infected <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html" title="">more than three million people</a> across the globe.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most intelligence agencies remain skeptical that conclusive evidence of a link to a lab can be found, and scientists who have studied the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html" title="">genetics of the coronavirus</a> say that the overwhelming probability is that it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">leapt from animal to human</a> in a nonlaboratory setting, as was the case with H.I.V., Ebola and SARS.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For months, spies and government officials have wrestled with varying theories about how the outbreak began. Many agree on the importance of determining the genesis of the pandemic. In government and academia, however, experts have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/03/experts-know-the-new-coronavirus-is-not-a-bioweapon-they-disagree-on-whether-it-could-have-leaked-from-a-research-lab/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ruled out the notion that it was concocted as a bioweapon</a>. And they agree that the new pathogen began as a bat virus that evolved naturally, probably in another mammal, to become adept at infecting and killing humans.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump leaned into the theory that it originated in a Chinese lab at a White House briefing on Thursday evening, but he offered no evidence. Asked if he had seen anything that gave him a high degree of confidence that the virus had originated at the lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Mr. Trump replied, “Yes, I have.” But asked what gave him that confidence, he said, “I can’t tell you that; I’m not allowed to tell you that.”</p>
<p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p>
<p class="css-8hvvyd">You now have fewer M.T.A. workers, you have fewer N.Y.P.D. workers on the trains and in the stations. We have now a greater need than ever to disinfect the subways, the buses and the stations. You want to honor the essential workers — Thank you, thank you, thank you. We’ll fly airplanes. We’ll have public demonstrations of gratitude. Yeah, even better than that is what you do and how you act. And let’s make sure that we’re doing everything we can. Let’s clean, disinfect those trucks, those buses and trains every 24 hours. I challenged the M.T.A. to come up with a plan. They came up with a plan. They can disinfect all trains and buses every night. It can best be done by stopping train service from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. every night during the pandemic so they can actually perform this service.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said Thursday that the New York City subway <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/nyregion/subway-close-cuomo-coronavirus.html" title="">would halt service</a> from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. each night so trains could be disinfected.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The policy will go into effect next Wednesday, the governor said. Public transit in New York City is the only system in the United States, and among the relatively few in the world, that runs 24 hours a day. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is as ambitious as anything we’ve ever undertaken,” Mr. Cuomo said.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that shuttle buses, dollar vans and even for-hire vehicles would provide what he called an “essential connector” during those hours to transport workers who needed to get to their jobs.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcement came after days of building tension over homeless people using subway trains as an alternative form of shelter and creating what many felt were unsanitary conditions on trains. On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo, who effectively controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the transit system, had declared the situation “disgusting.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The governor said Thursday that Mayor Bill de Blasio would help lead the effort to coordinate transportation during the subway’s service gaps, and praised the mayor for his cooperation.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. de Blasio, appearing at Mr. Cuomo’s briefing via video, said that the effort would be a way to help homeless people, whose life on the subways he called “an unacceptable reality.” </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gilead Sciences plans to give away the first 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, an antiviral drug shown to modestly reduce recovery time in virus patients, if the Food and Drug Administration grants emergency approval.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gilead could charge for the drug under a so-called emergency use authorization from the agency. But at least at the beginning, Gilead will provide the drug free of charge, Dan O’Day, the company’s chief executive, said in an interview on Thursday.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company started planning in January to manufacture remdesivir in large quantities, well before a large federal trial of the antiviral drug began at the end of February.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The results, announced by administration officials on Wednesday, showed that patients receiving the drug recovered in 11 days on average, compared with 15 days for patients receiving a placebo.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the results were “a very important proof of concept” but not a “knockout.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gilead has about 1.5 million vials of remdesivir on hand, enough to treat 140,000 to 150,000 patients with a 10-day course, Mr. O’Day said. Gilead should have enough to treat 500,000 patients by the fall, and one million by December, he added.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gilead has not decided yet on whether or what to charge for the drug in the long run, Mr. O’Day said.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gilead has a controversial history with drug pricing, noted Aaron Kesselheim, a health care economist at Harvard.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company bought a drug that cured hepatitis C from a small company, and then charged so much for it that many state Medicaid programs and prison systems could not afford it.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Kesselheim said pricing for remdesivir should take into account a large public investment in the drug. It was developed and tested by scientists at Vanderbilt University and Emory University, among other institutions, and the federal trial was taxpayer-funded, he noted.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Food and Drug Administration has authorized emergency use of a high-pressure ventilator developed by NASA engineers who usually work on interplanetary space missions. The device is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/health/ventilators-coronavirus.html" title="">one of numerous ventilators and other medical tools</a> that engineers and scientists around the world have devised to help hospitals respond to the strain of Covid-19 cases.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Vice President Mike Pence was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/coronavirus-pence-mask.html" title="">photographed wearing a face mask for the first time</a> on Thursday during a visit to a General Motors plant in Indiana that had been converted into a ventilator production site.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Pence was criticized this week for flouting the guidelines of Mayo Clinic that asked for all visitors to wear face masks. Surrounded by administration officials and medical professionals wearing masks, Mr. Pence appeared to be the only person at the clinic who was not covering his face.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, Mr. Pence defended himself, saying he was tested regularly for the virus, so there was no need for him to wear a mask because he was not at risk of contributing to asymptomatic spread, an argument that experts immediately dismissed as faulty. But in his first public outing since then, Mr. Pence appeared to concede to public pressure and covered his face.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He did not address the fact that he appeared to have ignored Mayo Clinic’s own guidelines. Administration officials said that Mr. Pence wore the mask in deference to G.M.’s policy at the plant he was visiting. They also said Mr. Pence was never informed of the Mayo Clinic’s policy and indicated Mr. Pence would continue to appear without a mask at other events.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Mayo Clinic shared the masking policy with the vice president’s office,” said Ginger Plumbo, a spokeswoman for the clinic.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Top Army leaders on Thursday defended their <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-west-point.html" title="">decision to summon 1,000 cadets back to West Point</a> in June for a graduation ceremony featuring a speech by the president. The students, who left campus in early March, would have to return anyway to take physical exams, pack their belongings and move out of their barracks, they said.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump and the academy have been criticized since he abruptly announced that he would be speaking at West Point, the only major service academy he had not yet addressed. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The West Point superintendent said on Thursday that returning seniors would be screened, tested and quarantined for 14 days before graduation. Ample medical supplies and personnel were on hand, he said, adding, “we’ve created a safety bubble.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By contrast, the city of Chicago had a workaround for its more than 40,000 graduating high school seniors: a virtual commencement featuring Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The ceremony, details of which are still being worked out, will take place in mid-June. It will include performances, speeches and a keynote address by Ms. Winfrey, who lives and works in the city and will not be paid for her remarks. Students from local private and religious schools will also be included.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Macy’s, one America’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/business/coronavirus-department-stores-neiman-marcus.html" title="">biggest department store</a> chains, announced on Thursday <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/business/macys-reopening-stores-coronavirus.html" title="">an ambitious plan to reopen</a> all of its 775 locations, including Bloomingdales and Bluemercury, in the next six to eight weeks, the latest sign of how eager the nation’s largest retailers are to return to business.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reopening plan will start on Monday with 68 stores in Georgia, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, and another 50 locations on May 11. Macy’s said it would reopen stores only in markets where state and local governments said it was safe for nonessential retailers to return to business. The chain <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/style/coronavirus-clothing-beauty-stores-closed.html" title="">temporarily closed</a> its stores on March 18, causing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/coronavirus-retail-furloughs-macys.html" title="">a majority of its sales</a> to disappear, and furloughed most of its 123,000 employees in the past month.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Macy’s expects that its reopened stores will bring in only about 15 to 20 percent of their typical business at first and “slowly build” from there, the company’s chief executive, Jeff Gennette, said during a presentation. He acknowledged that it was an open question as to whether shoppers would return.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There will be new protocols for fitting rooms and beauty counters, associates will wear<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>cloth masks and sometimes gloves, hand sanitizer stations will be placed by elevators and escalators and plexiglass barriers will be installed at cash registers.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A report from Harvard researchers adds to the growing doubts about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drugs that Mr. Trump has repeatedly advocated for virus patients.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The drugs “should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits,” the researchers wrote, in an article posted Thursday in The Faseb Journal, published by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authors found evidence that the drugs could harm Covid patients, but no evidence that they could help, in an analysis of 10 published studies.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The drugs can cause dangerous abnormalities in heart rhythm, especially in high doses or when combined with the antibiotic azithromycin — which some doctors have recommended — or with other drugs that may also disrupt heart rhythm.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Food and Drug Administration <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">issued a similar warning</a> last week, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/health/nih-covid-19-treatment.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">as did the agency led by Dr. Fauci</a>, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Harvard researchers also noted that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine affect the immune system, which could have unintended consequences in virus patients, maybe even diminishing their ability to fight it off.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The pandemic has hit small and independent restaurants hard, forcing owners to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/magazine/closing-prune-restaurant-covid.html" title="">shutter dining rooms and lay off employees</a>. But the shutdowns have done more than imperil the restaurants’ financial health; they have made the buildings themselves tempting targets for burglars emboldened by the quiet streets and deserted spaces.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Across the country, closed restaurants have been invaded by thieves who seem especially drawn to well-stocked liquor cabinets, iPads and other equipment.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s the perfect storm,” said Kam Razavi, an owner of a California restaurant who watched from his phone as security cameras recorded a burglar helping himself to the best bottles in the bar. “They know everybody is probably at home with a loaded gun. They’re not going to go rob homes. They’re going to go to closed businesses.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When his restaurant was broken into in early April, Mr. Razavi had already laid off most of his 75 or so employees and was uncertain whether he would ever reopen. Now, he is out $5,000 from stolen alcohol, a broken door and cleanup costs. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most restaurant owners who have had burglaries expect their insurance companies to cover at least a portion of the damage, though the pandemic has created backlogs for claims, delaying payments in some cases. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1255669977278906368?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said on Wednesday evening</a> that any city and county resident who wanted a virus test can get one, whether or not they were showing symptoms, making Los Angeles the “first major city in America” to offer free virus testing to all residents.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Priority will still be given to health care employees, other workers who interact with the public and people with symptoms, but asymptomatic residents will also be able to get tests.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“So, if you think you might have Covid-19, want the reassurance that you don’t or you’ve been around people that you have seen with symptoms, get a test,” the mayor said. “We can do it.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gov. Gavin Newsom of California had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/california-reopen-coronavirus.html" title="">outlined this week</a> how the state might gradually reopen, and Mr. Garcetti said the availability of testing was a “really important step to prepare for other steps forward.”</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is unclear how many people will sign up to be tested or how long they will have to wait. Just over six million people have been tested in the United States, including about 603,000 in California, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to Johns Hopkins University data</a>. More than 10 million people live in Los Angeles County, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In response to a reporter’s question about how the city would manage to test so many people, Mr. Garcetti said the city had tests left over each day and was confident in its ability to test any resident who wanted it, including those who want to get tested multiple times over the course of several weeks or months.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Garcetti said the testing would be carried out at 34 sites in the city that have the capacity to test at least 18,000 people each day. At least 140,000 people have been tested at those sites in the past month, he said.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 22,485 people in Los Angeles County <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">have tested positive for the virus</a>, and the death toll there has risen to 1,056.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Phones and computers are keeping us tethered to the outside world during the pandemic. But being thoughtful about your use of screens can help you emerge from this crisis empowered. </p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Britain is not ready to loosen restrictions, even as its neighbors do so. The Russian prime minister says he is sick with the coronavirus.</p>

They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.</p>
<p>This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-model-us-outbreak.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq"> how well the virus is contained</a>. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/National-Coronavirus-Response-a-Road-Map-to-Recovering-2.pdf">an American Enterprise Institute report</a>, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/upshot/coronavirus-four-benchmarks-reopening.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">staked out four goal posts for recovery</a>: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.</p>
<p>The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts <a href="https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/neediest-cases-fund-covid-relief">donations here</a>. <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=7779">Charity Navigator</a>, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html">American Red Cross</a>, and <a href="https://wck.org/">World Central Kitchen</a> has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/c/act/covid19">GoFundMe fund-raisers</a> have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/style/gofundme-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">means more of them are likely to fail </a>to meet their goal, though.)</p>
<p>The C.D.C. has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">recommended</a> that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq"> new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms</a>. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.</p>
<p>If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. </a>They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.</p>
<p>It seems to spread <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">very easily from person to person,</a> especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.</p>
<p>No. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-competition.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">Clinical trials are underway</a> in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.</p>
<p>Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">little is known about this particular virus so far.</a> It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.</p>
<p>If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.</a> If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.</p>
<p>Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/coronavirus-food-shortages.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">the supply chain remains strong.</a> And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.</p>
<p>Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/your-money/stock-market-changes-virus.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">That’s not a good idea.</a> Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.</p>
<p>Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/your-money/target-date-funds-stock-market.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-national®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;context=storyline_faq">You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t!</a> If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”</p>

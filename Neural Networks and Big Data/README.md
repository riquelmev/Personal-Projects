These two projects are the culmination of my Artifical Neural Networks class and my Computational Analysis of Big Data class. I worked on my Architecture CNN by myself and the NLP analysis of Reddit data was a group effort between myself, Ben Santos, and Silas Rhyneer.

To go along with that code, I have some articles on medium explaining what I was doing. Those can be found https://riquelmev.medium.com/classifying-architectural-styles-using-neural-networks-96fb879c27a5
